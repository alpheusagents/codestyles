# Alpheus Coding Style (Rust)

## Overview

- use snake_case directories and files; `mod.rs` in every directory-module
- imports grouped `std` → external → `crate::`, one crate per `use`, blank-line separated
- use `crate::` for all intra-crate paths, never `self::` or `super::` (except `use super::*;` in inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`)
- use only `pub` and `pub(crate)` for visibility; avoid other `pub(...)` forms
- prefer to annotate every local explicitly, even when inferable
- prefer a separate test workspace member; inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` allowed per repo
- `.unwrap()` only in tests, avoid in fallible library code

These rules are enforced by the code. Violating the letter is violating the spirit.

## When to Use

- creating a new file in a repo
- writing or editing any `.rs` file
- asked to "match Alpheus style" / "write like Alpheus"

## When NOT to Use

- a repo with its own AGENTS.md that explicitly contradicts a rule below

## Topics

This skill is split across sub-files so the agent loads only what it needs.

The rules in this `SKILL.md` apply to every keystroke. For everything else, read the relevant sub-file first.

Sections within each reference run general → specific, declarative → behavioural → exceptional; the most universally-applied rule first, the most situational last.
