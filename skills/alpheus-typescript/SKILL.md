# Alpheus Coding Style (TypeScript)

## Overview

- prefer functional programming
- prefer arrow functions with a single options-object parameter
- prefer `createX` naming for factory functions
- prefer return explicitly typed object from functions
- annotate every variable, parameter and return type explicitly
- prefer `type` aliases over `interface`
- prefer `void 0` over `undefined` wherever it appears as a value
- end every file that has named exports with grouped exports, type-only group first

These rules are enforced by the code. Violating the letter is violating the spirit.

## When to Use

- creating a new file in a repo
- writing or editing any `.js` / `.ts` / `.jsx` / `.tsx` file
- asked to "match Alpheus style" / "write like Alpheus"

## When NOT to Use

- a repo with its own AGENTS.md that explicitly contradicts a rule below

## Topics

This skill is split across sub-files so agent loads only what they needs.

The rules in this `SKILL.md` apply to every keystroke. For everything else, read the relevant sub-file first.

Sections within each reference run general → specific, declarative → behavioural → exceptional; the most universally-applied rule first, the most situational last.
