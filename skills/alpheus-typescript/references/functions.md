# Functions

## General

Prefer a typed `XxxOptions` bag (see `./types.md`) so later parameters do not break existing call sites. This is suggested for future-proofing.

## Arrow Functions Only

Prefer arrow functions unless explicitly requested.

```ts
const xxx = (options: XxxOptions): XxxResult => {};
```

## `async` / `await` Over `.then` / `.catch`

Avoid to chain `.then()` / `.catch()`. Use `async` / `await` so error paths flow through `try` / `catch` like synchronous code.

```ts
// ✗ never
const fetchThing = (): Promise<Thing> => fetch(url).then((r) => r.json());

// ✓
const fetchThing = async (): Promise<Thing> => {
    const response: Response = await fetch(url);
    return await response.json();
};
```

## Single Options-object Parameter (Suggested)

Prefer a single typed options-object parameter. Use it when the function is public, takes several related arguments, or may gain parameters later. Positional parameters are fine for small, stable internal helpers and when a framework or existing API requires a fixed signature.

```ts
// ✓ suggested when the function may grow
const createReport = (options: ReportOptions): Report => {};

// ✓ fine for a small, stable helper
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b;
```

## Organization within a file

Files flow top to bottom: imports, then declarations in dependency order, then grouped named exports when present, always last (see `./imports-exports.md`). Keep type-only exports before value exports and omit empty groups. A file with no named exports ends after its declarations. Framework-required inline exports are the exception; keep them where the framework requires them (see `./imports-exports.md`).

Dependency first: a callee appears before its caller. Helpers first, primary function last. All non-exported `const` arrows; the orchestrator calls them.

```ts
const a = (): Promise<void> => {};

const b = (): Promise<void> => {};

const c = (): Promise<void> => {
    a();
    b();
};
```

When two items have no dependency between them, the non-exported item comes before the exported one:

```ts
const tag = (): string => "v1";

const createReport = (): Report => {
    /* ... */
};

export type { Report };
export { createReport };
```

Dependency outranks this tie-break: if `tag` depended on `createReport`'s result, `createReport` would come first instead.

A value's supporting `type` alias appears immediately before the value that uses it. When item X depends on item Y, X's section follows Y's:

```ts
type ReportOptions = {
    maxLength: number;
};

const createReport = (options: ReportOptions): Report => {
    /* ... */
};
```

## `createXxx` factories for stateful modules

- avoid classes for application state
- return a typed object of methods

```ts
const createXxx = () => {
    return {
        isXxx: true,
        doXxx: () => {},
    };
};

type Xxx = ReturnType<typeof createXxx>;
```

Within the returned object literal, methods are ordered in dependency order: a method called by another method appears first (helpers before their callers); with no dependency, simpler/predicate helpers (e.g. `isX`) come before the primary operations.

```ts
const createCounter = () => {
    const isEmpty = (count: number): boolean => {
        return count === 0;
    };

    const increment = (count: number): number => {
        return count + 1;
    };

    return {
        isEmpty,
        increment,
    };
};

type Counter = ReturnType<typeof createCounter>;
```

## Classes for `Error` Sub Classes

You cannot extend `Error` with a factory. Every error class sets its own name:

```ts
class CustomError extends Error {
    override name: string = "CustomError";

    constructor(options: CustomErrorOptions) {
        const message: string = options.message ?? "Something went wrong";
        super(message);
    }
}
```

## Overload Idiom (Only When Public API Needs Two Call Signatures)

Two JSDoc'd public `function` overloads, then one implementation accepting the union first arg, dispatched by a type guard:

```ts
function createResponse<B extends BodyInit = BodyInit>(
    options?: CreateResponseOptions<B>,
): Response;

function createResponse<B extends BodyInit = BodyInit>(
    context?: Context,
    options?: CreateResponseOptions<B>,
): Response;

function createResponse<B extends BodyInit = BodyInit>(
    contextOrOptions?: Context | CreateResponseOptions<B>,
    options?: CreateResponseOptions<B>,
): Response {
    // ...
}
```
